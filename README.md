Hackers are breaking the systems for profit. Before, it was about intellectual curiosity and pursuit of knowledge and thrill, and now hacking is big business.Share this Quote
Kevin Mitnick
Hackers are becoming more sophisticated in conjuring up new ways to hijack your system by exploiting technical vulnerabilities or human nature. Don't become the next victim of unscrupulous cyberspace intruders.Share this Quote
Kevin Mitnick
Everything about Mark Zuckerberg is pure hacker. Hackers don't take realities of the world for granted; they seek to break and rebuild what they don't like. They seek to outsmart the world.Share this Quote
Sarah Lacy
In the aftermath of the oh-so-predictable crash, the Bitcoin fanatics have begun marshaling out excuse after excuse for why this non-investment investment lost so much of its value so fast. One was that hackers attacked some of the exchanges for Bitcoins and crippled it. Really? A hacker can wreck an entire market?Share this Quote
Kurt Eichenwald
I really didn't understand why hackers would want to hack into a classroom. Are they going to learn algebra? Maybe calculus? - Eric Yuan

Eric Yuan
If you wanna know how not secure you are, just take a look around. Nothing's secure. Nothing's safe. I don't hate technology, I don't hate hackers, because that's just what comes with it, without those hackers we wouldn't solve the problems we need to solve, especially security.Share this Quote
Fred Durst
Very smart people are often tricked by hackers, by phishing. I don't exclude myself from that. It's about being smarter than a hacker. Not about being smart.Share this Quote
Harper Reed
Too many public and private entities simply don't take advantage of tools already at their disposal to protect themselves from hackers. No amount of information sharing will help solve that problem.Share this Quote
Jared Polis
Growth hackers are typically computer engineers that build great marketing ideas into the product during the development process.Share this Quote
Ryan Holiday
We face cyber threats from state-sponsored hackers, hackers for hire, global cyber syndicates, and terrorists. They seek our state secrets, our trade secrets, our technology, and our ideas - things of incredible value to all of us. They seek to strike our critical infrastructure and to harm our economy.Share this Quote
James Comey
My parents had a software company making children's software for the Apple II+, Commodore 64 and Acorn computers. They hired these teenagers to program the software, and these guys were true hackers, trying to get more colors and sound and animation out of those computers.Share this Quote
Bre Pettis
We fear hackers lifting our digital wallet, a public accounting of our private lives, and we wonder if the shoes that follow us around the Internet will someday, with the click of a distant mouse, look like the jackboots of old.Share this Quote
Richard Cohen
See, unlike most hackers, I get little joy out of figuring out how to install the latest toy.Share this Quote
Jamie Zawinski
Hackers often describe what they do as playfully creative problem solving.Share this Quote
Heather Brooke
I don't hate technology, I don't hate hackers, because that's just what comes with it, without those hackers we wouldn't solve the problems we need to solve, especially security.Share this Quote
Fred Durst
When Clinton traveled to Russia, known for its hackers and cyber warfare against the United States and other democracies, she didn't bother to tap into the government-protected email system provided by the State Department. Instead, she continued to communicate through her personal, home-brewed and unsecured server.Share this Quote
Katie Pavlich
For the first time, individual hackers could afford to have home machines comparable in power and storage capacity to the minicomputers of ten years earlier - Unix engines capable of supporting a full development environment and talking to the Internet.Share this Quote
Eric S. Raymond
It is not just software glitches and corrupted memory cards that should be on the minds of election officials. Hackers pose another very real problem whereby an election could be tilted towards a favored candidate.Share this Quote
Bob Barr
If I compared myself to my kids, they know everything, and they're like small little hackers. I feel also that my identity can be stolen; I'm very paranoid about it compared to other people in the younger generation.Share this Quote
Michael Nyqvist
When hackers have access to powerful computers that use brute force hacking, they can crack almost any password; even one user with insecure access being successfully hacked can result in a major breach. - Toomas Hendrik Ilves

Toomas Hendrik Ilves
Social engineering has become about 75% of an average hacker's toolkit, and for the most successful hackers, it reaches 90% or more.Share this Quote
John McAfee
One of my favourite books about hackers is 'Masters of Deception' about this hacking group in the 1990s. Many of them didn't come from wealthy families. These are kids that are very intelligent; they just happen to be misdirected.Share this Quote
Harper Reed
If Wikileaks didn't resolve that question for folks - at the end of the day, there are no secrets. We're living in a glass neighborhood, in a fishbowl, and technology, white hat hackers, the folks that are doing the right thing with hacking.Share this Quote
Gavin Newsom
Computer hackers do not need to know each other's real names, or even live on the same continent, to steal millions in mere hours.Share this Quote
Robert Mueller
Virality is not an accident. It is engineered. And that's why growth hackers beat traditional marketers.Share this Quote
Ryan Holiday
Are hackers a threat? The degree of threat presented by any conduct, whether legal or illegal, depends on the actions and intent of the individual and the harm they cause.Share this Quote
Kevin Mitnick
Hackers rarely have full knowledge of the technology stack of a target.Share this Quote
John McAfee
As we work to secure our data and communications from hackers, we must recognize that our citizens face a far broader array of threats.Share this Quote
William Barr
Garbage can provide important details for hackers: names, telephone numbers, a company's internal jargon.Share this Quote
Kevin Mitnick
New security loopholes are constantly popping up because of wireless networking. The cat-and-mouse game between hackers and system administrators is still in full swing. - Kevin Mitnick

Kevin Mitnick
I will say that one of the things that hackers, of all shapes and sizes, prize the most in this world is anonymity and stealth and deniability. And by indicting them publicly, among other things, we strip them of that.Share this Quote
Christopher A. Wray
Simple genome engineering of bacteria and yeast is just the beginning of the rise of the true biohackers. This is a community of several thousand people, with skill sets ranging from self-taught software hackers to biology postdocs who are impatient with the structure of traditional institutional lab work.Share this Quote
Ryan Bethencourt
I met a lot of hackers, and some of them were very arrogant. They thought I was stupid because I couldn't follow what they were talking about. But then I met this great guy whom companies hire to find their security holes, and he was very good about explaining so I could understand.Share this Quote
David Lagercrantz
I seem to be getting a lot of things pushed my way that are strong women. It's like people see Hackers and they send me offers to play tough women with guns, the kind who wear no bra and a little tank top. I'd like to play strong women who are also very feminine.Share this Quote
Angelina Jolie
It is only the inadequacy of the criminal code that saves the hackers from very serious prosecution.Share this Quote

Evgeny Morozov
The openness on which Apple had built its original empire had been completely reversed - but the spirit was still there among users. Hackers vied to 'jailbreak' the iPhone, running new apps on it despite Apple's desire to keep it closed.Share this Quote
Jonathan Zittrain
What fashion has started from hackers? They have bad posture, and they don't go out. I wish I had a hacker boyfriend - they stay at home up in the bedroom.Share this Quote
John Waters
I'm a hacker, but I'm the good kind of hackers. And I've never been a criminal.Share this Quote
Mikko Hypponen
Growth hackers don't tolerate waste.Share this Quote
Ryan Holiday

Erik Voorhees
Hackers are seen as shadowy figures with superhuman powers that threaten civilization.Share this Quote
Mitch Kapor
Should we fear hackers? Intention is at the heart of this discussion.Share this Quote
Kevin Mitnick
While many hackers have the knowledge, skills, and tools to attack computer systems, they generally lack the motivation to cause violence or severe economic or social harm.Share this Quote
Dorothy Denning
Younger hackers are hard to classify. They're probably just as diverse as the old hackers are. We're all over the map.Share this Quote
Larry Wall
While the vast majority of hackers may be disinclined towards violence, it would only take a few to turn cyber terrorism into reality.Share this Quote
Dorothy Denning
Berkeley hackers liked to see themselves as rebels against soulless corporate empires.Share this Quote
Eric S. Raymond
The one thing that I know from the personal experiences that I've had with hackers and from people in tech who are brilliant at this thing, is there's a lot of angst.Share this Quote
Sam Esmail
In the epic war over Silicon Valley's intellectual property, Bill Gates was on the side of licensing copyright and robust protections for intellectual property. He wasn't on the side of the hackers, and he didn't want information to be free.Share this Quote
Franklin Foer
I am well aware of the facts presented by numerous security experts on the many ways in which the United States' digital networks have come under siege by cybercriminals and under daily assault by hackers in league with various foreign governments.Share this Quote
Rebecca MacKinnon
The workstation-class machines built by Sun and others opened up new worlds for hackers.Share this Quote
Eric S. Raymond
Well, take the evolution of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It began as hackers' rights. Then it became general civil liberties of everybody - government stay away.Share this Quote
Esther Dyson
For countries such as Kenya to emerge as economic powerhouses, they need better infrastructure: roads, ports, smart grids and power plants. Infrastructure is expensive, and takes a long time to build. In the meantime, hackers are building 'grassroots infrastructure,' using the mobile-phone system to build solutions that are ready for market.Share this Quote
Ethan Zuckerman
If hackers, if anyone committing a criminal act, wants to reduce their risk, they obviously don't involve anybody else. The greater the circle of people that know what you're doing, the higher the risk.Share this Quote
Kevin Mitnick
An element of virtually every national security threat and crime problem the FBI faces is cyber-based or facilitated. We face sophisticated cyber threats from state-sponsored hackers, hackers for hire, organized cyber syndicates, and terrorists.Share this Quote
James Comey
Digital warfare, in the Clausewitz definition as 'the continuation of policy by other means,' reached Western public consciousness via my own country, Estonia, in 2007 when our governmental, banking, and news media servers were hit with 'distributed denial-of-service attacks,' which is when hackers overload servers until they shut down.Share this Quote
Toomas Hendrik Ilves
What we're looking at is a future where cars will be comfortable and safe and offer the luxuries of both home and office. That means lots of sensors and software, as well as the critical safety systems to protect the car's information from hackers.Share this Quote
Dinesh Paliwal
I talked to the general counsel of the DNC, and he assures me that every step along the way, when we were notified of these issues, that we changed systems, changed procedures, but these hackers are so sophisticated that they changed procedures.Share this Quote
Donna Brazile
I think the thing that our government lacks - just about more than anything else - is technological competence. We have some of the greatest white-hat hackers in the world here in the U.S., but the government seems to be technologically illiterate.Share this Quote
